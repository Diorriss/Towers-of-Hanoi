# How it simulates

## The towers
- The towers are represented by the towers array
- the first tower is A, the second tower is B, and the last is C

## The Discs
- The Discs print out their movement number (from step 0 to 2) 0-0-2.
  - Once the first disc reaches step 2, it carries of to the next disc and resets to 0 which would equal to 0-1-0   
- The Discs print out the current tower they are occupying alongside their current step count. (1, B)
